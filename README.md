# Improved_Loss_Functions


Loss functions play a crucial role in training machine learning models. They quantify the disparity between predicted values and ground truth labels, guiding the model towards better performance. As the field of machine learning advances, researchers continuously explore and develop improved loss functions to address specific challenges and improve model capabilities.

One area of focus in developing better loss functions is handling class imbalance in classification tasks. Traditional cross-entropy loss can lead to biased models when classes are imbalanced, favoring the majority class. To address this, novel loss functions like Focal Loss and Class-Balanced Loss have been introduced. Focal Loss reduces the impact of well-classified examples, emphasizing the harder ones, thus mitigating the imbalance issue. Class-Balanced Loss adjusts the contribution of each class during training to prevent the dominance of the majority class.
